Step 1: Install Prerequisite Software

Nagios requires the following packages are installed on your server prior to installing Nagios:

* Apache
* PHP
* GCC compiler
* GD development libraries

You can use yum to install these packages by running the following commands (as ec2-user):

-> sudo yum install httpd php
-> sudo yum install gcc glibc glibc-common
-> sudo yum install gd gd-devel


Step 2: Create Account Information

You need to setup a Nagios user. Run the following commands:

-> sudo adduser -m nagios
-> sudo passwd nagios

Type the new password twice. Then create a new nagcmd group for allowing external commands to be submitted through the web interface:

-> sudo groupadd nagcmd
-> sudo usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios
-> sudo usermod -a -G nagcmd apache


Step 3: Download Nagios Core and the Plugins

Create a directory for storing the downloads.

-> mkdir ~/downloads
-> cd ~/downloads

Download the source code tarballs of both Nagios and the Nagios plugins (visit http://www.nagios.org/download/ for links to the latest versions). These directions were tested with Nagios Core 4.0.8 and Nagios Plugins 2.0.3.

-> wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/nagios/nagios-4.0.8.tar.gz
-> wget http://nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.0.3.tar.gz


Step 4: Compile and Install Nagios

Extract the Nagios source code tarball.

-> tar zxvf nagios-4.0.8.tar.gz
-> cd nagios-4.0.8

Run the Nagios configure script, passing the name of the group you created earlier like so:
-> ./configure --with-command-group=nagcmd

Compile the Nagios source code.
-> make all

Install binaries, init script, sample config files and set permissions on the external command directory.
-> sudo make install
-> sudo make install-init
-> sudo make install-config
-> sudo make install-commandmode


Step 5: Customize Configuration

Sample configuration files have now been installed in the /usr/local/nagios/etc directory. These sample files should work fine for getting started with Nagios. You'll need to make just one change before you proceed...

Edit the /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg config file with your favorite editor and change the email address associated with the nagiosadmin contact definition to the address you'd like to use for receiving alerts.

-> sudo vim /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg


Step 6: Configure the Web Interface

Install the Nagios web config file in the Apache conf.d directory.

-> sudo make install-webconf

Create a nagiosadmin account for logging into the Nagios web interface. Remember the password you assign to this account - you'll need it later.
-> sudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin

Type the new password twice. Restart Apache to make the new settings take effect.
-> sudo service httpd restart


Step 7: Compile and Install the Nagios Plugins

Extract the Nagios plugins source code tarball.

-> cd ~/downloads
-> tar zxvf nagios-plugins-2.0.3.tar.gz
-> cd nagios-plugins-2.0.3

Compile and install the plugins.

-> ./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios
-> make
-> sudo make install


Step 8: Start Nagios

Add Nagios to the list of system services and have it automatically start when the system boots.

-> sudo chkconfig --add nagios
-> sudo chkconfig nagios on

Verify the sample Nagios configuration files.

-> sudo /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

If there are no errors, start Nagios.

-> sudo service nagios start

Add port 80 to aws security group

You should now be able to access the Nagios web interface to do this you will need to know the Public DNS or IP for your instance, you can get this from the Instance section of the EC2 Console if you do not already know it. You'll be prompted for the username (nagiosadmin) and password you specified earlier.

e.g. http://ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xx.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/nagios/

Click on the "Service Detail" navbar link to see details of what's being monitored on your local machine. It will take a few minutes for Nagios to check all the services associated with your machine, as the checks are spread out over time.
